        <p>Nature is an important and integral part of mankind. It is one of the greatest blessings for human life;
            however,
            nowadays humans fail to recognize it as one. Nature has been an inspiration for numerous poets, writers,
            artists and
            more of yesteryears. This remarkable creation inspired them to write poems and stories in the glory of it.
            They truly
            valued nature which reflects in their works even today. Essentially, nature is everything we are surrounded
            by like the
            water we drink, the air we breathe, the sun we soak in, the birds we hear chirping, the moon we gaze at and
            more. Above
            all, it is rich and vibrant and consists of both living and non-living things. Therefore, people of the
            modern age
            should also learn something from people of yesteryear and start valuing nature before it gets too late.

        <h1 class="header">Significance of Nature</h1>
        <p>Nature has been in existence long before humans and ever since it has taken care of mankind and nourished it
            forever. In
            other words, it offers us a protective layer which guards us against all kinds of damages and harms.
            Survival of mankind
            without nature is impossible and humans need to understand that. <br> <br>

            If nature has the ability to protect us, it is also powerful enough to destroy the entire
            mankind. Every
            form of nature,
            for instance, the plants, animals, rivers, mountains, moon, and more holds equal significance for us.
            Absence of one
            element is enough to cause a catastrophe in the functioning of human life. <br> <br>

            We fulfill our healthy lifestyle by eating and drinking healthy, which nature gives us.
            Similarly, it
            provides us with
            water and food that enables us to do so. Rainfall and sunshine, the two most important elements to survive
            are derived
            from nature itself

        <h1 class="header">Conservation of Nature</h1>
        <p>In order to conserve nature, we must take drastic steps right away to prevent any further damage. The most
            important
            step is to prevent deforestation at all levels. Cutting down of trees has serious consequences in different
            spheres. It
            can cause soil erosion easily and also bring a decline in rainfall on a major level. <br> <br>
            Polluting ocean water must be strictly prohibited by all industries straightaway as it causes a lot of water
            shortage.
            The excessive use of automobiles, AC's and ovens emit a lot of Chlorofluorocarbons' which depletes the ozone
            layer.
            This, in turn, causes global warming which causes thermal expansion and melting of glaciers. <br> <br>

            Therefore, we should avoid personal use of the vehicle when we can, switch to public transport and
            carpooling. We must
            invest in solar energy giving a chance for the natural resources to replenish.

        <p>nature has a powerful transformative power which is responsible for the functioning of life on earth. It is
            essential
            for mankind to flourish so it is our duty to conserve it for our future generations. We must stop the
            selfish activities
            and try our best to preserve the natural resources so life can forever be nourished on earth.
